# The-Camus-Method

## Ten Core Principles

1. Use a lexicon. The lexicon defines all terms.  
2. Structures and objects represent terms. Primitives cannot represent terms.  
3. Public variables must be term representatives. Functions operate on term representatives.  
4. Functions declare input and output term representatives, plus any constraints.  
5. Functions expose their intended claims.  
6. Limit blocks and control-flow depth to one level; no nested blocks.  
7. Favor composition, not inheritance.  
8. No anonymous functions. No interfaces.  
9. Enforce style consistency with a linter.  
10. Certify functions only when fully understood and trusted.
