# The Camus Method

The Camus Method is a methodology for writing, auditing, and certifying software using a hybrid human-AI process.  
It is **language-agnostic** and can be applied on top of existing languages through embedded Camus annotations.

## Core Principles

1. **Human-in-the-loop certification**  
   Code is written or suggested by AI and **audited, reviewed, and certified by a human**.  
   The human is ultimately responsible for correctness, security, and semantics.

2. **Lexicon-driven semantics**  
   Every project maintains a **lexicon of terms** that explicitly define the meaning of domain concepts.  
   Functions, structures, and modules use these terms to ensure that the code is **self-descriptive and auditable**.

3. **Separation of intention and implementation**  
   - **Terms** describe *what* a value or object means in the project context.  
   - **Constraints** describe *what* a function requires to operate.  
   - **Structures / implementations** map terms to concrete data and algorithms.

4. **Semantic constraints on composition**  
   - Only terms can pass between functions.  
   - Primitives can be used internally but cannot leak outside a function.  
   - Structures implement interfaces corresponding to terms, guaranteeing functional compatibility while preserving meaning.

5. **Gradual coverage & auditability**  
   - Projects can adopt Camus partially.  
   - Coverage is measured in multiple dimensions: global, critical, strictness, and human-certified percentage.  
   - Transparent reporting is mandatory for claiming “uses Camus.”

6. **Complexity limitation**  
   The methodology enforces constraints that limit cognitive and algorithmic complexity, ensuring maintainable, auditable code.

7. **Embedded in comments for external languages**  
   - Camus annotations can be embedded in comments for any target language.  
   - These annotations reproduce the **semantic contracts, term definitions, and constraints** of Camus.

## Workflow

1. **Lexicon proposal** – AI proposes a lexicon of terms for the domain.  
2. **Lexicon validation** – Human reviews and certifies terms.  
3. **Function skeletons** – AI proposes function signatures with intended terms.  
4. **Human validation** – Human approves or adjusts skeletons.  
5. **Implementation** – AI generates structures, interfaces, and function bodies.  
6. **Testing & certification** – Human audits, tests, and certifies the code.

## Coverage and Reporting

The `kiss` tool (or equivalent) measures:

- **Camus Coverage:** proportion of code under Camus methodology  
- **Critical Coverage:** coverage of project-critical areas  
- **Certification Percentage:** proportion reviewed and approved by humans  
- **Strictness Level:** rules enforced per module or function  

Only with a **transparent report** can a project claim “Uses Camus.”

## Philosophy

The Camus Method is **not a policing mechanism**.  
It is a **trust and audit framework**:

- Emphasizes **responsibility over enforcement**.  
- Promotes **gradual adoption**, highlighting progress rather than penalizing incompleteness.  
- Transforms software development into a **measurable, semantically auditable activity**, independent of language.

> Camus does not certify code.  
> Camus certifies the **degree of trust we can place in code**.

## Status

This project is a **foundational reference**, not a finished methodology.  
It defines the **minimum rules** for code to be considered compliant with Camus principles and provides the basis for embedding Camus in any programming language.
